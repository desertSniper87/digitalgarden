## Assessment Overview
- **Assessment Methodology**
- **Scan Information**
  - Information such as the type of scan performed, tools used, versions, and the assets scanned.
- **Target Information**
  - Information about the target system’s name and address.
- **Tools Involved**

## Findings
- **Scanned Hosts, Including Each Host’s Detailed Information**
  - `<Node>`: Name and address of the host
  - `<OS>`: Operating system type
  - `<Date>`: Date of the test
  - Vulnerable services: Network services by their names and ports.

- **Affected Assets**
