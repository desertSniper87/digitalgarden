Dynamic Malware Analysis, also known as behavioral analysis, involves **executing malware code** to learn how it interacts with the host system and its impact after infecting the system.

Dynamic analysis involves the execution of malware to examine its conduct and operations and identify technical signatures that confirm the malicious intent. It reveals information such as domain names, file path locations, created registry keys, [[IP Address\|IP Addresses]], additional files, installation files, and [[Dynamic Link Library\|dll]] and linked files located on the system or network.
