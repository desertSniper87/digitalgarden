Android separates the flash storage into the following two main partitions.

- `/system/`
- `/data/`

- The partition `/system/` is used by the operating system, and the partition `/data/` is used for user data and application installations
- In Android, users don't have root access to the operating system, and some partitions (like `/system/`) are `read-only`
- However, **rooting the device can be achieved by exploiting security flaws**
- Having a rooted device enhances the capabilities and customizability of the device, and helps with debugging and overall security assessments
- Rooted Android devices are also more susceptible to malicious [[virus\|virus]] and [[Malware\|Malware]], since the **rooting process disables some of the built-in security features of the operating system**
- In some models like Google Pixel and OnePlus, rooting can also be achieved by unlocking the [[bootloader\|bootloader]] via the OEM Unlocking option.
