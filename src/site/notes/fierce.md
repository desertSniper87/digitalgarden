- Attackers can use this tool to enumerate subdomains related to the target domain
- It also enables them to identify non-contiguous IP spaces and hostnames that are linked with specified domains or subdomains
- attackers can create a network environment and identify the potential targets for exploitation


```bash
perl fierce.pl -dns <domain_name>
```
