**Network Access Control (NAC)** is a security solution that manages and enforces policies related to access to a network. It ensures that only authorized devices and users are allowed to access the network, and it restricts access to those who do not meet specific security requirements. NAC is an essential part of a **comprehensive network security** strategy, especially in environments with sensitive data and systems.
