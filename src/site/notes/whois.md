The Whois database isÂ ==a **public, searchable directory** that **provides information** about [[Domain name\|Domain]] name registrations and [[IP Address\|IP]] address allocations== 
## whois cli command 
```bash
whois 159.13.20.79
```


Each WHOIS record typically contains the following information:

- Domain Name: The [[Domain name\|Domain name]] itself (e.g., example.com)
- Registrar: The **company** where the domain was **registered** (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap)
- Registrant Contact: The **person** or organization that **registered** the domain.
- Administrative Contact: The **person** responsible for **managing** the domain.
- Technical Contact: The **person** handling **technical** issues related to the domain.
- Creation and Expiration Dates: **When** the domain was registered and when it's set to **expire**.
- Name Servers: Servers that translate the domain name into an IP address.

## Example

```bash
Domain Name: EXAMPLE.COM
Registrar: IANA
Creation Date: 1995-08-14
Registry Expiry Date: 2025-08-13
Name Server: A.IANA-SERVERS.NET
