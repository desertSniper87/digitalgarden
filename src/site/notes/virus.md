A **virus** is a type of **malware** that attaches itself to legitimate programs or files and spreads from one system to another, typically causing harm by corrupting data, stealing sensitive information, or disrupting normal operations. It is called a “virus” because, like a biological virus, it **infects** systems, replicates, and spreads to other systems or programs.
