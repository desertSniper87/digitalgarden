The host-based scanning tools are appropriate for servers that run various applications, such as the Web, critical files, databases, directories, and remote accesses. These host-based scanners can detect high levels of vulnerabilities and provide required information about the fixes (patches). A host-based vulnerability assessment tool identifies the OS running on a particular host computer and tests it for known deficiencies. It also searches for common applications and services.
