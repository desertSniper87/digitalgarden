 - ACO is inspired by the foraging behavior of ants
 - It uses a colony of artificial ants that cooperatively search for good solutions by *depositing pheromones on the* **edges of a graph**
 - The **pheromone trails** guide **future ants** towards promising solutions
 - ACO has been used for the [[travelling salesman problem\|travelling salesman problem]], [[Graph Colouring Problem\|Graph Colouring Problem]], and routing in communication networks.
