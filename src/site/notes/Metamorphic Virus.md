Metamorphic viruses are programmed such that they **rewrite themselves completely** each time they infect a new executable file
 - Such viruses are sophisticated and use metamorphic engines for their execution
 - Metamorphic code reprograms itself
 - It is translated into temporary code (a new variant of the same virus but with different code) and then converted back into the original code
 - This technique, in which the original algorithm remains intact, is used to avoid pattern recognition by [[antivirus\|antivirus]] software
 - Metamorphic viruses are more effective than [[Polymorphic Virus\|polymorphic virus]]es



The transformation of virus bodies ranges from simple to complex, depending on the technique used. Some techniques used for metamorphosing viruses are as follows: 

- [[Disassembler\|Disassembler]] 
- [[Expander\|Expander]] 
- [[Permutator\|Permutator]] 
- [[Assembler\|Assembler]]

Virus bodies are transformed in the following steps: 
 - Inserts dead code 
 - Reshapes expressions 
 - Reorders instructions 
 - Modifies variable names 
 - Encrypts program code 
 - Modifies program control structure
