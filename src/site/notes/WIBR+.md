**WIBR+** (WiFi Bruteforce) is an Android application designed to assess the security of Wi-Fi networks, specifically targeting WPA/WPA2 PSK protocols. It allows users to test whether their routers are vulnerable to WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) PIN attacks by attempting to connect using default or commonly used PINs. The app employs various algorithms to facilitate this process.
