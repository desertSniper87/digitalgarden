Application-layer vulnerability assessment tools are designed to serve the needs of all kinds of operating system types and applications. Various resources pose a variety of security threats and are identified by the tools designed for that purpose. Observing system vulnerabilities through the Internet using an external router, firewall, or webserver is called an external vulnerability assessment. These vulnerabilities could be external DoS/DDoS threats, network data interception, or other issues. The analyst performs a vulnerability assessment and notes vulnerable resources. The network vulnerability information is updated regularly into the tools. Application-layer vulnerability assessment tools are directed towards web servers or databases.
