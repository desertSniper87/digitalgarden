Systems set up with limited security, also known as honeypots, act as enticement for an attacker. Recent research reveals that a honeypot can imitate all aspects of a network, including its web servers, mail servers, and clients. Honeypots are intentionally set up with low security to gain the attention of DDoS attackers and serve as a means for gaining information about attackers, attack techniques, and tools by storing a record of the system activities. DDoS attackers attracted by a honeypot install handlers or agent code within the honeypot. This avoids compromising systems that are more sensitive. Honeypots not only protect the actual system from attackers but also keep track of details on the attackers’ activities by recording the activity information. Consequently, the honeypot owner can keep a record of the handler and/or agent activity. Users can employ this knowledge to defend against any future DDoS installation attacks. A defense-in-depth approach with Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) can be used at different network points to divert suspicious DoS traffic to several [[Honeypot\|Honeypot]]. 

There are two different types of honeypots: ▪ Low-interaction honeypots ▪ High-interaction honeypots
