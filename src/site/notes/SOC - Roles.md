## Roles Within A SOC

A SOC team consists of diverse roles responsible for handling the continuous, operational aspect of enterprise information security. These roles may encompass:

- `SOC Director`: Responsible for overall management and strategic planning of the SOC, including budgeting, staffing, and alignment with organizational security objectives.
    
- `SOC Manager`: Oversees day-to-day operations, manages the team, coordinates incident response efforts, and ensures smooth collaboration with other departments.
    
- `Tier 1 Analyst`: Monitors security alerts and events, triages potential incidents, and escalates them to higher tiers for further investigation.
    
- `Tier 2 Analyst`: Performs in-depth analysis of escalated incidents, identifies patterns and trends, and develops mitigation strategies to address security threats.
    
- `Tier 3 Analyst`: Provides advanced expertise in handling complex security incidents, conducts threat hunting activities, and collaborates with other teams to improve the organization's security posture.
    
- `Detection Engineer`: A Detection Engineer is responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining detection rules and signatures for security monitoring tools, such as SIEM, IDS/IPS, and EDR solutions. They work closely with security analysts to identify gaps in detection coverage and continuously improve the organization's ability to detect and respond to threats.
    
- `Incident Responder`: Takes charge of active security incidents, carries out in-depth digital forensics and containment and remediation efforts, and collaborates with other teams to restore affected systems and prevent future occurrences.
    
- `Threat Intelligence Analyst`: Gathers, analyzes, and disseminates threat intelligence data to help SOC team members better understand the threat landscape and proactively defend against emerging risks.
    
- `Security Engineer`: Develops, deploys, and maintains security tools, technologies, and infrastructure, and provides technical expertise to the SOC team.
    
- `Compliance and Governance Specialist`: Ensures that the organization's security practices and processes adhere to relevant industry standards, regulations, and best practices, and assists with audit and reporting requirements.

It is important to note that the specific roles and responsibilities within each tier can vary depending on the organization's size, industry, and specific security requirements.

In general, the tiered structure can be described as follows:

- `Tier 1 Analysts`: Also known as "first responders," these analysts monitor security events and alerts, perform initial triage, and escalate potential incidents to higher tiers for further investigation. Their main goal is to quickly identify and prioritize security incidents.
    
- `Tier 2 Analysts`: These analysts are more experienced and perform deeper analysis of escalated incidents. They identify patterns and trends, develop mitigation strategies, and sometimes assist in incident response efforts. They may also be responsible for tuning security monitoring tools to reduce false positives and improve detection capabilities.
    
- `Tier 3 Analysts`: Often considered the most experienced and knowledgeable analysts on the team, Tier 3 analysts handle the most complex and high-profile security incidents. They may also engage in proactive threat hunting, develop advanced detection and prevention strategies, and collaborate with other teams to improve the organization's overall security posture.
