- How many servers to be kept active
- How much workload to be **delayed** for energy saving while meeting every deadline.
- We present an offline LP formulation for capacity provisioning by dynamic deferral and give two online algorithms to:
	- determine the capacity of the data center
	- the assignment of workload to servers dynamically.

    - Dynamically turns on/off servers in a data center to minimize energy cost and delay cost for scheduling workload
    - Aims at minimizing the average delay (penalizing delay)
    - 3-competitive solution
    - No bounds on maximum delay.
