- Variation on [[Cloud/Dynamic Capacity Provisioning/Follow the workload\|Follow the workload]]

[Dynamic Deferral of Workload for Capacity Provisioning in Data Centers - Adnan](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.3839.pdf)
The energy cost function
consists of two parts: operating cost and switching cost.



• We use the flexibility of deferral for capacity provisioning
to reduce energy consumption.
– Defer some of the workload to reduce variation in the workload.
