1. `Malicious Insiders`: These are individuals who intentionally seek to cause harm. They might steal sensitive information, sabotage systems, or commit fraud for personal gain, revenge, or to benefit another organization.
    
2. `Negligent Insiders`: These individuals don't intend to cause harm but do so through carelessness or lack of awareness. For example, an employee might accidentally send confidential information to the wrong email address or fall for a phishing scam that compromises security.
    
3. `Compromised Insiders`: In this case, external attackers gain access to insider credentials, like usernames and passwords, often through hacking or social engineering. They then operate within the organization's systems as if they were legitimate users.
