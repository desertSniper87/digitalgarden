Information can be gathered from domains, IP addresses, accessible services, and many other sources.
The primary goals of web reconnaissance include:

- `Identifying Assets`: Uncovering all publicly accessible components of the target, such as web pages, subdomains, IP addresses, and technologies used. This step provides a comprehensive overview of the target's online presence.
- `Discovering Hidden Information`: Locating sensitive information that might be inadvertently exposed, including backup files, configuration files, or internal documentation. These findings can reveal valuable insights and potential entry points for attacks.
- `Analysing the Attack Surface`: Examining the target's attack surface to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses. This involves assessing the technologies used, configurations, and possible entry points for exploitation.
- `Gathering Intelligence`: Collecting information that can be leveraged for further exploitation or social engineering attacks. This includes identifying key personnel, email addresses, or patterns of behavior that could be exploited.
