Fake AntiVirus Fake or rogue antivirus software is a form of Internet fraud based on malware. It appears and
performs similarly to a real antivirus program. Fake antivirus software is often displayed in banner ads, pop-ups, email links, and search engine results when searching for antivirus software. A well-designed fake antivirus software looks authentic and often encourages users to install it on their systems, perform updates, or remove viruses and other malicious programs.
Upon clicking the ad, pop-up, or link to install the antivirus software, users are redirected to another page where they are prompted to buy or subscribe to that antivirus software by entering their payment details. Fake antivirus software can cause severe damage to systems once downloaded and installed; e.g., they infect systems with malicious software, steal sensitive information (e.g., passwords, bank account numbers, credit card data), and corrupt files.

At present, a new fake antivirus trend has emerged. Fake antivirus tools are rapidly proliferating the mobile application space. According to AV-Comparatives research, two-thirds of all antivirus applications present in the Android Play Store are fake. â–ª Antivirus 10 Antivirus 10 is a fake antivirus software pretending to be a legitimate antivirus suite. It is distributed as a potentially unwanted program (PUP) with regular software applications. Antivirus 10 first imitates a system scan and shows several fake threats found in the system. It creates fake system warnings, firewall alerts, unwanted redirects to malicious websites, antivirus pop-ups, and encourages users to buy the full version.

Some additional fake antivirus programs are as follows:

- AVLab Internet Security
- Smart Security
- PC Analyzer Tool
- Live Protection Suite
