- Supplies data
	- From one app to app
- Share content from one app to another


- Content Providers can be considered as Application Components and Interprocess Communication (IPC) mechanisms
- As an **[[Inter Process Communication\|IPC]] mechanism**
	 - Content Providers enable communication between applications by allowing them to:
		 - access
		 - modify
		 - delete data using a consistent interface through the `ContentResolver` class
- As an application component
	 - Content Providers are responsible for **managing and exposing data structures** within or to other apps
- At the same time
	 - they allow **data sharing** between **different components in the app** or with external apps
- In other words
	 - they act as the **intermediate between the app** and its underlying data storage
- Content Providers use a standardized API based on the CRUD:
	 - Create
	 - Read
	 - Update
	 - Delete operations to interact with data
- The data handled by a Content Provider can be stored in multiple structures
	 - including local [[db/sqlite\|SQLite]] databases
	 - the device's internal or external storage
	 - or even on a remote server.

Accessing a `ContentProvider` is typically done asynchronously in the background using a `CursorLoader` to execute queries. The `Activity` or UI component initiates a request to the `CursorLoader`
	 - which performs the query by accessing the `ContentProvider` via the `ContentResolver`. This approach keeps the UI responsive while executing the query. The process involves multiple components
	 - as demonstrated in the following image.

The following code snippet retrieves words and their locales from the User Dictionary Provider
- A [User Dictionary Provider](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/UserDictionary) is a `ContentProvider` in Android that manages the user's custom dictionary
- To achieve this
	 - it calls `ContentResolver.query()`
	 - which in turn invokes the `ContentProvider.query()` method implemented by the User Dictionary Provider.


```java
// Queries the user dictionary and returns results
cursor = getContentResolver().query(
    UserDictionary.Words.CONTENT_URI,  // The content URI of the words table
    projection,                        // The columns to return for each row
    selectionClause,                   // Selection criteria
    selectionArgs,                     // Selection criteria
    sortOrder);                        // The sort order for the returned rows
```

- Content Providers extend the `ContentProvider` class.

```java
public class MyContentProvider extends ContentProvider {
    // Implement required CRUD methods and other logic here
}
```

- Content Providers, along with the [permissions](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-provider-basics#Permissions) required to access the provider's data, must be declared in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

```xml
<manifest ...>
    <application ...>
        <provider
            android:name=".MyContentProvider"
            android:authorities="com.example.myapp.provider"
            android:exported="false" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

- Similar to Activities and Broadcast Receivers, Content Providers can be accessed using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) through the terminal.
