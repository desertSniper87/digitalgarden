[linpostexp](https://github.com/reider-roque/linpostexp) is a collection of Linux [[Privilege Escalation\|post-exploitation]] enumeration and exploit checking tools. It assists penetration testers and security researchers in identifying potential privilege escalation vectors on compromised Linux systems.


One notable script in this collection is linprivchecker.py, which helps identify potential privilege escalation vectors on Linux systems. It checks for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges.
