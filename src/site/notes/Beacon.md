In cybersecurity, a **beacon** refers to a signal or communication sent from a compromised device to a remote server (often controlled by the attacker) to establish or maintain communication. It acts as a form of **ping** or **callback** from a **malware** or a **botnet** to a **[[Command and Control Server\|command-and-control]] (C&C) server**, letting the attacker know the device is ready for further instructions or that it is still active on the network.
