Malware code instrumentation is a technique used in cybersecurity to analyze and understand the behavior of malicious software by injecting additional code or instructions into specific points within binary code. These instructions allow the capture of important events or actions performed by malware during execution, such as logging function calls, tracking memory allocations, monitoring network communications, and recording file system interactions in real time. Furthermore, analysts can examine the collected data to understand their behavior, attack techniques, capabilities, and intent, and develop effective countermeasures to mitigate the threats posed by malware. Malware code instrumentation is a challenging process owing to the complexity of analyzing and modifying binary code, and attacks may employ anti-analysis techniques to avoid detection and thwart instrumentation. Tools such as [[Frida\|Frida]] and [[HawkEye\|HawkEye]] can be used to perform code instrumentation.
