Malware code emulation is a technique used to perform a static/dynamic malware analysis of suspected malware samples. It creates an isolated virtual environment to run a malware sample by mimicking its hardware and software requirements without interrupting its actual functionality. Unlike sandboxing, which involves an isolated environment containing a real operating system to run malware samples for behavior analysis, code emulation temporarily creates features such as processors, memory, hard disks, network devices, operating systems, antivirus, and system registries. Malware emulators provide more control over the execution of malware and can create breakpoints to pause execution, allowing the malware to bypass anti-malware techniques. They can emulate and run malware on multiple operating systems. Moreover, they require fewer resources than sandboxes and can operate on any host system.


Some other malware code emulators are as follows:

- [[qemu\|QEMU]] 
- Windows_Malware_Emulator (https://github.com)
