Depth assessment tools are used to discover and identify previously unknown vulnerabilities in a system. Generally, tools such as fuzzers, which provide arbitrary input to a systemâ€™s interface, are used to identify vulnerabilities to an unstable depth. Many of these tools use a set of vulnerability signatures to test whether a product is resistant to a known vulnerability or not.
