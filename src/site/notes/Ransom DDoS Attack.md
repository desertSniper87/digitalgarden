The DDoS extortion attack is also referred to as ransom DDoS (RDDoS)
==- Herein, attackers threaten the target organizations with a DDoS attack and insist them to pay a specified ransom amount==
- The attacker either sends a ransom note or initiates a sample DDoS attack using a botnet on specific resources of the organizations to make them believe that the attack is real
- Consequently, an email with a ransom or extortion note with the payment option, deadline, etc
- is delivered to the victim and warns that the original attack can be launched at any moment
- The ransom note may also include short messages or a series of messages threatening the victim with vulnerabilities, exposed assets, or data followed by instructions for ransom payment through digital currency
- Generally, attackers fake these attacks claiming that they have high-capacity DDoS capability tools that can cause potential damage to the organizationâ€™s business.
