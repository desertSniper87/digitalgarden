## MAC Frame

| Field                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Frame Control          | This field contains tons of information such as type, subtype, protocol version, to ds (distribution system), from DS, Order, etcetera.                                                                                                        |
| Duration/ID            | This ID clarifies the amount of time in which the wireless medium is occupied.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Address 1, 2, 3, and 4 | These fields clarify the MAC addresses involved in the communication, but they could mean different things depending on the origin of the frame. These tend to include the BSSID of the access point and the client MAC address, among others. |
| SC                     | The sequence control field allows additional capabilities to prevent duplicate frames.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Data                   | Simply put, this field is responsible for the data that is transmitted from the sender to the receiver.                                                                                                                                        |
| CRC                    | The cyclic redundancy check contains a 32-bit checksum for error detection.                                                                                                                                                                    |
