Attackers can implement malware that uses various tricks for executing code that cannot be detected by security solutions.
- The fast flux method allows attackers to change both the IP addresses and DNS names rapidly, and is typically utilized by large
Module botnets.
- This technique allows attackers to evade various security controls.
- It also helps the attacker to circumvent blacklists and hide the C&C server behind the compromised systems operating as reverse proxies.
- In this process, a victim system will only connect to the fast flux agents instead of the legitimate C&C server.
