# Comparing Approaches to Vulnerability Assessment

There are four types of vulnerability assessment solutions: product-based solutions, service-based solutions, tree-based assessment, and inference-based assessment.

## Product-Based Solutions

[[Product-based Security solutions\|Product-based Security solutions]] are installed in the organization’s internal network. They are installed either on a **private** or **non-routable** space or in the Internet-addressable portion of an organization’s network. If they are installed on a private network (behind the [[Firewall\|Firewall]]), they cannot always detect outside attacks.

## Service-Based Solutions

Service-based solutions are offered by third parties, such as **auditing** or [[Security Consulting Firms\|Security Consulting Firms]]. Some solutions are hosted inside the network, while others are hosted outside the network. A drawback of this solution is that attackers can perform network vulnerability scans from the Internet/external network.

## Tree-Based Assessment

In a tree-based assessment, the auditor selects different **strategies** for **each machine** or component of the information system. For example, the administrator selects a [[Scanner\|Scanner]] for servers running [[Windows\|Windows]], [[db/Database\|Database]], and web services but uses a different scanner for [[os/Linux\|Linux]] servers. ==This approach relies on the administrator to provide a starting piece of intelligence==, and then to start scanning continuously without incorporating any information found at the time of scanning.

## Inference-Based Assessment

In an inference-based assessment, scanning starts by building an [[Inventory\|Inventory]] of the [[Protocol\|Protocol]] found on the machine. After finding a protocol, the scanning process starts to detect which [[Port\|Ports]] are attached to services, such as an [[email server\|email server]], [[Webserver\|Webserver]], or [[database server\|database server]]. After finding services, it selects vulnerabilities on each machine and starts to execute only those relevant tests.
