| Technique                | Description                                                                                   | Example                                                                                                                                            | Tools                                                                     | Risk of Detection                                                                                                                     |

| `Port Scanning`          | Identifying open ports and services running on the target.                                    | Using Nmap to scan a web server for open [[Port\|Ports]] like 80 ([[net/protocols/Hypertext Transfer Protocol\|HTTP]]) and 443 ([[net/protocols/HTTPS\|HTTPS]]).                      | [[net/sec/tools/nmap\|Nmap]], [[net/sec/tools/masscan\|Masscan]], [[Unicornscan\|Unicornscan]]                                    | High: Direct interaction with the target can trigger intrusion detection systems ([[Intrusion Detection System\|IDS]]) and firewalls. |
| `Vulnerability Scanning` | Probing the target for known vulnerabilities, such as outdated software or misconfigurations. | Running Nessus against a web application to check for SQL injection flaws or cross-site scripting ([[net/sec/Cross Side Scripting\|XSS]]) vulnerabilities. | [[Nessus\|Nessus]], [[openvas\|OpenVAS]],[[nikto\|Nikto]]                                         | High: Vulnerability scanners send exploit payloads that security solutions can detect.                                                |
| `Network Mapping`        | Mapping the target's network topology, including connected devices and their relationships.   | Using traceroute to determine the path packets take to reach the target server, revealing potential network hops and infrastructure.               | [[Traceroute\|Traceroute]], [[net/sec/tools/nmap\|Nmap]]                                                  | Medium to High: Excessive or unusual network traffic can raise suspicion.                                                             |
| `Banner Grabbing`        | Retrieving information from banners displayed by services running on the target.              | Connecting to a web server on port 80 and examining the HTTP banner to identify the web server software and version.                               | [[net/sec/tools/netcat\|Netcat]], [[curl\|curl]]                                                      | Low: Banner grabbing typically involves minimal interaction but can still be logged.                                                  |
| `OS Fingerprinting`      | Identifying the operating system running on the target.                                       | Using Nmap's OS detection capabilities (`-O`) to determine if the target is running Windows, Linux, or another OS.                                 | [[net/sec/tools/nmap\|Nmap]], [[Xprobe2\|Xprobe2]]                                                     | Low: OS fingerprinting is usually passive, but some advanced techniques can be detected.                                              |
| `Service Enumeration`    | Determining the specific versions of services running on open ports.                          | Using Nmap's service version detection (`-sV`) to determine if a web server is running Apache 2.4.50 or Nginx 1.18.0.                              | Nmap                                                                      | Low: Similar to banner grabbing, service enumeration can be logged but is less likely to trigger alerts.                              |
| `Web Spidering`          | Crawling the target website to identify web pages, directories, and files.                    | Running a web crawler like Burp Suite Spider or OWASP ZAP Spider to map out the structure of a website and discover hidden resources.              | [[burpsuite\|burp]] Suite Spider, OWASP ZAP Spider, Scrapy (customisable) | Low to Medium: Can be detected if the crawler's behaviour is not carefully configured to mimic legitimate traffic.                    |
