This attack happens when an **Access Point (AP)** is set up with poor or insecure configurations. For instance, weak passwords, unencrypted communication (e.g., WEP), or default settings can leave the AP vulnerable to **man-in-the-middle** attacks, **eavesdropping**, or **session hijacking**. Attackers can exploit these weaknesses to intercept network traffic or gain unauthorized access to the local network.
