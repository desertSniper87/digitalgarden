A `software firewall` is a security application installed on individual computers or devices that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Unlike hardware firewalls that protect entire networks, software firewalls (also called Host-based firewalls) provide protection at the device level, guarding against threats that may bypass the network perimeter defenses. They help prevent unauthorized access, reject incoming packets that contain suspicious or malicious data, and can be configured to restrict access to certain applications or services. For example, most operating systems include a built-in software firewall that can be set up to block incoming connections from untrusted sources, ensuring that only legitimate network traffic reaches the device.
