## Distributed System

- Collection of independent computing processes.


Two types of systems:

- [[System Design/Distributed Computing/Asynchronous Distributed System|Asynchronous Distributed System]]
- [[System Design/Distributed Computing/Synchronous Distributed System|Synchronous Distributed System]]
