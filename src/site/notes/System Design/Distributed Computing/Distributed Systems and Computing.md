## Distributed System

- Collection of independent computing processes.


Two types of systems:

- [[System Design/Distributed Computing/Asynchronous Distributed System\|Asynchronous Distributed System]]
- [[System Design/Distributed Computing/Synchronous Distributed System\|Synchronous Distributed System]]

## Leader Election

- One process to act as coordinator, and typically, *it does not matter which process is actually chosen*.
