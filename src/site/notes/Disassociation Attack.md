A [Disassociation Attack](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-disassociation-attacks/) is a type of `all` wireless network attack that aims to disrupt the communication between a WAP and its clients by sending disassociation frames to one or more clients.

The WAP uses disassociation frames to disconnect a client from the network. When a WAP sends a disassociation frame to a client, the client will disconnect from the network and have to reconnect to continue using the network.

We can launch the attack from `within` or `outside` the network depending on our location and network security measures. The purpose of this attack is to disrupt the communication between the WAP and its clients, causing the clients to disconnect and possibly causing inconvenience or disruption to the users. We can also use it as a precursor to other attacks, such as a MITM attack, by forcing the clients to reconnect to the network and potentially exposing them to further attacks.
