> In [[graph theory\|graph theory]], a dominating set for a **graph G** is a **subset D** of its vertices, such that any vertex of G is in D, or has a neighbor in D. The domination number Î³(G) is the number of vertices in a smallest dominating set for G

every vertex in the graph is:
- in the dominating set
- or adjacent to a vertex in the dominating set.
