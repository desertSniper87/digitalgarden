## Malware Disassembly


- Static analysis also includes the dismantling of a given executable into binary format(translating raw binary back into assembly instructions) to study its functionalities and features
- This process helps to identify:
	- the language used for programming the malware
	- The APIs that reveal its function
- Based on the reconstructed assembly code
	- you can inspect the program logic and recognize its threat potential
