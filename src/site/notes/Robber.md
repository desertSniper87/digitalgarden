Refers to a malware family known as **OSX.DubRobber**, a Trojan dropper targeting macOS systems. Written predominantly in AppleScript, it downloads additional malicious components on demand. Once installed, it can function as a backdoor, stealing data from applications like Telegram and Evernote, and even encrypting files in a ransomware-like manner.
