`uniscan` is a popular web vulnerability scanner that automates the detection of common vulnerabilities in web applications. Itâ€™s often used in security assessments to look for weak spots like SQL injections, XSS, and directory/file vulnerabilities. Here are some basic `uniscan` commands to get started:

### Basic Scan
Scan a single URL for common vulnerabilities:
```bash
uniscan -u http://example.com -qweds
```
Options:
- `-q`: Check for directories.
- `-w`: Check for files.
- `-e`: Check for errors.
- `-d`: Dynamic checks (XSS, SQL Injection, etc.).
- `-s`: Static checks (HTML comments, exposed JS files).

### Directory and File Brute Forcing
To brute-force common directories and files:
```bash
uniscan -u http://example.com -qwf
```

### Custom User Agent
To use a custom User-Agent string:
```bash
uniscan -u http://example.com -qweds -a "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)"
```

### SQL Injection and XSS Only
If you want to focus only on SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities:
```bash
uniscan -u http://example.com -ds
```

### Verbose Mode
For more detailed output:
```bash
uniscan -u http://example.com -qweds -v
```

### Save Output to a File
To save the results of the scan:
```bash
uniscan -u http://example.com -qweds -o output.txt
```

### Perform a Scan on Multiple URLs
You can use `uniscan` with a file containing multiple URLs:
```bash
uniscan -f urls.txt -qweds
```

These examples can help automate initial checks for common vulnerabilities but remember to use tools like this ethically and with permission if targeting external sites.
