- Pre-Assessment Phase 
	- Identify Assets and Create a Baseline
		- The pre-assessment phase is a preparatory phase, which involves defining policies and standards, clarifying the scope of the assessment, designing appropriate information protection procedures, and identifying and prioritizing critical assets to create a good baseline for vulnerability management and to define the risk based on the criticality and value of each system.
- [[Vulnerability Assessment\|Vulnerability Assessment]] Phase 
	- Vulnerability Scan 
	- Vulnerability Analysis
- Post Assessment Phase 
	- [[Risk analysis\|Risk Assessment]] 
		- In the risk assessment phase, risks are identified, characterized, and classified along with the techniques used to control or reduce their impact.
	- Remediation 
		- Remediation is the process of applying fixes on vulnerable systems in order to mitigate or reduce the impact and severity of vulnerabilities. 
	- Verification 
		- In this phase, the security team performs a re-scan of systems to assess if the required remediation is complete and whether the individual fixes have been applied to the impacted assets. 
		- It provides clear visibility into the firm and allows the security team to check whether all the previous phases have been perfectly employed or not.
	- Monitoring
		- Continuous monitoring identifies potential threats and any new vulnerabilities that have evolved.
