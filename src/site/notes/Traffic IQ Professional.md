Traffic IQ Professional is a tool that audits and validates the behavior of security devices by generating the standard application traffic or attack traffic between two virtual machines. This tool is generally used by security personnel for assessing, auditing, and testing the behavioral characteristics of any non-proxy packet-filtering device, which can include application firewalls, IDS, IPS, routers, switches, etc. However, as this tool can generate custom attack traffic, it is extensively employed by attackers to bypass the installed perimeter devices in the target network
