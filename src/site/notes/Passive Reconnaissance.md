| `Search Engine Queries`     | Utilising search engines to uncover information about the target, including websites, social media profiles, and news articles. | Searching Google for "`[Target Name] employees`" to find employee information or social media profiles.                                           | [[Google Dorks\|google]], DuckDuckGo, Bing, and specialised search engines (e.g., Shodan)            | Very Low: Search engine queries are normal internet activity and unlikely to trigger alerts.           |
| `WHOIS Lookups`             | Querying WHOIS databases to retrieve domain registration details.                                                               | Performing a WHOIS lookup on a target domain to find the registrant's name, contact information, and name servers.                                | [[whois\|whois]] command-line tool, online WHOIS lookup services                                            | Very Low: WHOIS queries are legitimate and do not raise suspicion.                                     |
| [[Domain Name System\|DNS]] | Analysing DNS records to identify subdomains, mail servers, and other infrastructure.                                           | Using `dig` to enumerate subdomains of a target domain.                                                                                           | [[sre/Tools/dig\|dig]], [[nslookup\|nslookup]], [[host\|host]], [[dnsenum\|dnsenum]], [[fierce\|fierce]], [[dnsrecon\|dnsrecon]],[[dnsdumpster\|dnsdumpster]], [[netcraft\|netcraft]] | Very Low: DNS queries are essential for internet browsing and are not typically flagged as suspicious. |
| `Web Archive Analysis`      | Examining historical snapshots of the target's website to identify changes, vulnerabilities, or hidden information.             | Using the Wayback Machine to view past versions of a target website to see how it has changed over time.                                          | [[Internet Archive\|Internet Archive]]                                                                                  | Very Low: Accessing archived versions of websites is a normal activity.                                |

| `Code Repositories`         | Analysing publicly accessible code repositories like GitHub for exposed credentials or vulnerabilities.                         | Searching GitHub for code snippets or repositories related to the target that might contain sensitive information or code vulnerabilities.        | GitHub, [[sre/Tools/git/implementation/Gitlab\|GitLab]]                                                                                   | Very Low: Code repositories are meant for public access, and searching them is not suspicious.         |
